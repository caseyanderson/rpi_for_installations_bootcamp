## Raspberry Pi 3 for Installations Bootcamp

This repository contains lecture notes and scripts for a workshop focusing on Raspberry Pi 3 for media installations. In other words, the basics of Unix, Bash, Python3, and Linux are introduced in the context of common media/art installation needs. These include:

* video/audio kiosk
* video switcher
* sensor input
* toggle lights/simple devices on/off
* deployment strategies (i.e. automatically launch on startup, run forever)
